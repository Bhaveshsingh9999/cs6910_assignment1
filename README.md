Below is the Decription of the Files 
for question 1 where we have to plot 1 sample image from each class the code for that question is q1.py 

for performing sweep from wandb first create new sweep and initilize the sweep with content of the file sweepinit.text which is present after the sweep is initialized
run the sweep.py file
using this sweep.py file it run a sweep in wandb and all the parameters that are initialized in the sweepinit combination of those parameter is taken and it keep on ruinning with all these various combination from this we take the hyperparamter set which give the highest validation accuracy 

From the second question onwards all the code is present in train.py and its has been set to best default values argparse argument can be used to pass any different value for the hyperparameter.
